# This NFA emulator supports single line comments at the start of a line or after a line.
# The emulator uses epsilon closure for more accurate recursive searches.

# Recognized Language: { w in {0, 1}+ | w = ({0,1}*){11, 101}({0,1}*) }
#                      (all strings that contain 11 or 101 at some point)
