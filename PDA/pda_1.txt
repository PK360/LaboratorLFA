# This PDA emulator supports single line comments at the start of a line or after a line.
# A PDA necessitates the existence of a stack alphabet, which keeps track of all possible symbols in the stack

# Rules can be defined as a 3-tuple or 5-tuple:
#   --> 3-tuples: (start, inp, end), where the stack rule is defaulted to epsilon -> epsilon.
#   --> 5-tuples: (start, inp, end, stack_top, stack_replace), being the full variant of a rule.

# Recognized Language: { w(w^r) | w in {0, 1}* } (all binary strings followed up by the inverse string)
