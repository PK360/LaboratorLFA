# This DFA emulator supports single line comments at the start of a line or after a line.
# Defining start and end states is defined by adding '=S' (start) or '=E' (end) after a state.

# Recognized Language: { w in {0, 1}* | |w| in 2N + 1 } (all string of an odd length)
[STATES]: q0 = s, q1 = E
[ALPHABET]: {0, 1}   # alphabet elements are defined in curly brackets
